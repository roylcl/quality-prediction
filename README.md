# Injection Moulding Machine - Quality Prediction 

This project is part of my university assignment focusing on supervised learning technique applied to experimental data collected from injection molding machine under 3 different manufacturing conditons: normal condition, condition n1 and condition n5. The project aims to use various machine learning algorithms to build models for prediction,  addressing the following tasks:

## Introduction

The project focuses on predicting the quality of an injection molding machine under different manufacturing conditions: normal, n1, and n5. The primary objectives include:
- **Problem Statement Discussion:** Understand and discuss the challenges and objectives related to predicting the quality of injection molding under different conditions.
- **Regression or Classification:** Determine whether the problem is a regression or classification issue based on the nature of the prediction task.
- **Data Separation:** Use the K-fold method to separate the experimental data into training and testing datasets.

## Features
- **Supervised Learning Techniques Implementation:** The project implements three different supervised learning algorithms for predictive modelling.
- **Data Modelling and Prediction:** Utilize the K-fold method for training and testing data models to predict the quality of the injection molding machine under different conditions.
- **Model Error Analysis:** Perform a comprehensive analysis of model errors to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of each method.

## Supervised Learning Techniques 
### Data Modelling
Implement the followning supervised learning techniques: 
1. **Decision Tree:** Tree-like structures where each node represents a decision based on the input features. They are particularly useful for their interpretability and ease of understanding.
2. **Random Forest:** It is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multinude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. 
3. **Support Vector Machine:** It is a versatile algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes in the feature space.
